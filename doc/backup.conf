.Sh NAME
.Nm backup.conf
.Nd configuration file for \fBbackup.pl\fP(67)
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration file is parsed by the \fBbackup.pl\fP(67) script. It
contains information regarding different backup tasks. This information
is used to construct \fBrsync\fP(1) calls to backup the contents of
the specified directories.
.Pp
Backup tasks are declared in blocks starting with a start tag on a single line
(which can be either "[UPDATE]" or "[BACKUP]") and ending with "[END]" on a
single line. In between these tags are other tags and properties (e.g. ID=Videos).
Recognized properties and tags are described in detail in the PROPERTIES and
TAGS sections.
.Pp
The [UPDATE] tag identifies an incremental backup task. This checks
the source directory for files that either do not exist or are older in the
destination directory and copies the new version to the backup directory.
These tasks require the SRC and DST properties to be defined.
.Pp
The [BACKUP] tag identifies a backup task. This recreates the entire source directory
tree in the specified backup directory and copies files based on the tags in
the task configuration. These are described in detail in the TAGS section.
A backup task requires at least the SRC and BPATH properties to be defined.
.Pp
.Sh PROPERTIES
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It ID
Sets the ID of the task. This is only used when the \fB--idtasks\fP flag is specified
when running the \fBbackup.pl\fP script. If the flag is present, the ID will be printed
when encountered during the parsing process. If multiple IDs are given, each will be printed.
.It SRC
Sets the source path for the backup task. If defined multiple times, the last path overrides
all previous instances.
.It DST
Sets the destination path for the backup task. If defined multiple times, the last path
overrides all previous instances.
.It FIFR, EXFR, INFR
Specifies files for \fBrsync\fP's \fB--files-from\fP, \fB--exclude-from\fP, and \fB--include-from\fP
flags, respectively. EXFR and INFR properties for [UPDATE] tasks are not currently supported. In
an [UPDATE] task, if FIFR is defined multiple times, the last instance overrides any previous ones.
In [BACKUP] tasks, the effect is cumulative: multiple exclude/include/from files can be specified; they
will all be added to the command line arguments passed to \fBrsync\fP.
.It BPATH
This property is only available in [BACKUP] tasks. It specifies the path to the directory that contains
all the backups. If defined multiple times, only the last one is used.
.It LDST
Specifies a path to be passed to \fBrsync\fP with the \fB--link-dest\fP flag. This property can
be defined multiple times; each instance will create a new flag passed to \fBrsync\fP.
.It CDST
Specifies a path to be passed to \fBrsync\fP with the \fB--compare-dest\fP flag. This property
can be defined multiple times just like the LDST property.

.Sh TAGS
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It [UPDATE]
Indicates the beginning of an incremental backup (update) task. Must be accompanied
by a matching [END] tag.
.It [BACKUP]
Indicates the beginning of a backup task. Must be accompanied by a matching [END] tag.
.It [END]
Marks the end of a task.
.It [CONFIRM]
Indicates that the program should ask the user for confirmation before running this task.
.It [COMPARE BPATH]
This tag is only available for [BACKUP] tasks. It indicates that all subdirectories of
the path specified by the BPATH property (required for [BACKUP] tasks) should be passed to
\fBrsync\fP with the \fB--compare-dest\fP flag. This tag must appear after the BPATH
property has already been defined or it will use the current working directory of the
shell environment used by Perl as its BPATH.
