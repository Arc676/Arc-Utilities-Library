.Dt "ARCMAN" "67" "Arc Utilities Library"
.Sh NAME
.Nm arcman
.Nd display man pages in custom directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar program_name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses the \fBman\fP(1) utility to display
manual pages found in the paths in the configuration file.
This utility is useful when you have programs with man pages
and want to put those man pages in a custom folder for any
reason. The configuration file must be at ~/.arcutillib/arcman.conf
.Pp
The Arc Utilities Library does NOT come with an install
OR uninstall script. Therefore, it is recommended that you keep
the man pages in a separate folder for easy deletion should it
be necessary. This is why the
.Nm
utility was created.
.Pp
If 'list' is given as the program name,
.Nm
will run \fBls\fP(1) on each path in the configuration file.
