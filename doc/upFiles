.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
(67) helper script is used by \fBbackup.pl\fP(67) to perform incremental updates.
It uses \fBrsync\fP(1) to perform these backups. As of August 22, 2017, the
.Nm
helper script is no longer necessary to run \fBbackup.pl\fP(67), as it can now
perform incremental backups independently. The script can still be used by itself
to perform unconfigured incremental backups.

before performing the backup.

flag is given.
