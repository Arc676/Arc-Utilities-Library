.Sh NAME
.Nm tree
.Nd graphically lists subdirectories showing relative depth in the filesystem

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar path
.Op Fl d Ar max_depth
.Op Fl r Ar regex
.Op Fl l Ar n
.Op Fl a
.Sp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses the \fBfind\fP(1) and \fBsed\fP(1) utilities to search the given directory for subdirectories
and replace the contents of the path with an appropriate number of dashes such that
the relative indentation of the folder name represents its depth in the entire filesystem (i.e. relative to the root folder).
If no path is specified, the current directory is used. However, if a path is given, it must
be the first argument.
.Pp
The output of the
.Nm
utility largely resembles the output of the Windows Command Prompt command with
the same name.
.Sp
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d Ar max_depth
Limits the depth of the search of the directory tree to
.Ar max_depth
.Sp
.It Fl r Ar regex
Sets the regex used by \fBfind\fP to
.Ar regex
.Sp
.It Fl a
When this flag is given,
.Nm
doesn't pass any regex to \fBfind\fP(1) at all, showing all directories.
.It Fl l Ar n
(The letter 'ell') Shifts the representation of the directory tree to the left by
.Ar n
units i.e. removes that many dashes from each entry, showing a shallower depth. This can be useful when using
.Nm
in a deeply nested directory. If an entry has less than
.Ar n
dashes, it will move completely to the left. If any entries originally had less dashes than were to be removed,
the output will no longer correctly represent the relative depth of the subdirectories, as all entries that had
.Ar n
or less dashes will be moved completely to the left, regardless of their respective depths.
