.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility automates the creation and authorization of SSH keys. It uses \fBssh-keygen\fP(1) to create a public/private
key pair named 'id_rsa' and \fBssh-copy-id\fP(1) to copy them to the remote host. If the remote host is configured to allow
public key authentication, this operation will allow the user who executes it to remotely log into the remote host without
entering the password each time. This also means that \fBscp\fP can be used without entering a password. Both flags must
be specified to run the script.
