.Nm openApps.pl
.Nd launches an arbitrary number of apps with \fBopen\fP(1)

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
Perl script asks the user to input app names until empty input is given.
Then, Mac's \fBopen\fP(1) command is used to launch all the applications.
For simplicity, the application names are quoted when the shell command is
run so that applications with spaces in their names don't need to be quoted
on input. To protect against code injection, if any single inputted app name
contains a quotation mark, it is ignored.
.Pp
The purpose of the
.Nm
script is to launch multiple applications together, possibly to restore a
workspace after logging in. This is useful for older devices: Macs still using
hard disk drives may be slow to boot up or restore applications when using
Apple's Resume capability (introduced in 10.7, Resume reopens everything when you restart
so you can continue working where you left off), so disabling it might actually save
more time than using it. By using the
.Nm
script, you can launch all the apps you need without having to use an app opener
such as Launchpad multiple times and without slowing down your Mac with Resume.
